# A quiz app with drag and drop made with Angular and jQuery UI  

An application made for Apprix in 17 hours that secured me the job of a Front End Developer.

I was given a web application that was made with flash and told to recreate that application as closely as possible with modern technologies. No responsive resizing was required.

I used jQuery UI for the drag and drop functionality and Angular for the rest of the app.
